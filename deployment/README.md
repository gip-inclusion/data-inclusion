# deployment

Only the pipeline is currently managed by this terraform configuration.

The pipeline is deployed on scaleway, from compiled images, using terraform in a github workflow.

The api and metabase are deployed on scalingo, from sources, using the scalingo github integration.

## provisioning

### prerequisites

* `terraform==1.5.x` (can be installed with an `asdf` plugin)

#### for the state backend

The state backend is shared by environments.

#### to provision an environment

The following resources must be created manually **before** running `terraform apply`.

Replace `<ENVIRONMENT>` with the identifier for the target environment : `prod`, `staging`, etc.

| External domain | `<ENVIRONMENT>.data.inclusion.gouv.fr` | Used to generate subdomains pointing to the server | The `data.inclusion.gouv.fr` domain is registered on Gandi |


ðŸ’¡ IAM applications must be created manually, because it would require the `data-inclusion-<ENVIRONMENT>-github` application to have full access to IAM management at the organization level.

### initializing the state backend

*Use the prerequisites for the state backend*

```bash
set +o history
terraform init \
    -backend-config "bucket=data-inclusion-tf-states" \
    -backend-config "key=<ENVIRONMENT>" \
    -backend-config "access_key=<ACCESS_KEY>" \
    -backend-config "secret_key=<SECRET_KEY>"
set -o history
```

where:

* `<ENVIRONMENT>` is an identifier for the target environment (`prod`, `staging`, etc.)
* `<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` are the api key pair associated to the state backend

### configuring the provisioning

The deployment is configured through variables. The set of variables will be different for each environment.

Variables must be defined in a `terraform.tfvars.json` in the deployment directory.

```bash
# Copy and fill the template
cp template.terraform.tfvars.json terraform.tfvars.json
```

### provisioning

```bash
# review changes
terraform plan

# apply
terraform apply
```

### prod and staging on github

Each environment has a dedicated github environment. In each of these gh environment, a `TF_VARS_BASE64` secret contains a base64 encoded version of `terraform.tfvars.json`, with all the variables for a given environment.

The files are stored on bitwarden as `<ENVIRONMENT>.terraform.tfvars.json`.

Use the following gh cli command to update this file on github:

```bash
# using gh cli
# replace <ENVIRONMENT>
base64 -w0 <ENVIRONMENT>.terraform.tfvars.json | gh secret --repo gip-inclusion/data-inclusion --env <ENVIRONMENT> set TF_VARS_BASE64
```

Make sure to update the config on bitwarden.

### formatting `.tf` files

A pre-commit hook is provided, make sure to `pre-commit install`!
