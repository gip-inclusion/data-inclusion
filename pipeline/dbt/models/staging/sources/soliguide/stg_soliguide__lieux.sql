/*
    Starting mid 2025, there are duplicated lieux in Soliguide. For instance,
    https://soliguide.fr/fr/fiche/62249 and https://soliguide.fr/fr/fiche/55997.

    These are two seperate entries in Soliguide with different `lieu_id` but
    representing the same physical location (same coordinates, same name, etc.).

    For now, duplicates can be identified by looking at the services they offer.
    Each service has a unique `serviceObjectId` that is consistent across
    duplicated lieux. Though this might not be enough if the two entries differ.

    Below, entries are deduplicated by keeping the most recently updated one.
    The remaining entries can be used to filter the `lieux` table.
